# Jbotsim

JBotSim is a simulation library for distributed algorithms in dynamic networks. The style of programming is mainly event-driven: your code can react to various events 
(pulse of a clock, appearance/disappearance of a link, arrival of a message, movement of the node, etc.). Node movements can be controlled by program (e.g. mobile robots or mobility models), or by means of mouse-based interactions during the execution. Beyond its features, the main asset of JBotSim is its simplicity of use.
